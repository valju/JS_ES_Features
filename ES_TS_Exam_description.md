# Typical ECMAScript plus TypeScript Exam 

(not guaranteed, but mostly pretty much like this)

ECMAScript & TypeScript exam has only multiple-choice tasks
About 20-32 multiple-choice questions:
* Select the best answer -type questions
* Select all that apply -type questions
    - Always 2p question: Select all **falsy values** from given 20 options (max 8, as document.all is 9th)
* (Order these items in a certain order -type questions)

Remember the general rules:

* if the task does not tell how many to select in "select all that apply" it can _rarely_ be 0, _rarely be all,
* could still be e.g. 1 out of 20 even if a 2p question.
* All in all you need to look at each option independently of other options, and independent of other questions, 
* ... and independent of how many points task gives. Totally unrelated to number of correct options.
