    <h1>ECMAScript examples - Read HTML for instructions</h1>

    <h2>Two sources to look at</h2>
    <h3>The code examples that can be linked to this page and run with debugger</h3>
    <h3>The Markdown listing of some same, some different features in a
        <a href="ES_advanced/ES_advanced_or_tricky_features.md">Markdown file
            (ES_advanced/ES_advanced_or_tricky_features.md)</a>.
    </h3>
    <p>Markdown lists (ES and TS) are the exam scope. And this repo MIGHT have some code examples explaining those.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>HINT 1: Remove and add comments in the source code of this HTML file to activate ONLY 1 file
        at time. Move those comment "teminators" to change which script is active, which is not.
    </p>

    <p>HINT 2: Open browser console. Put debugger break point at least at the end of the file. Refresh. Sometimes you
        might
        put in the beginning as well, to follow some process.
    </p>

    <p>HINT 3: Use VS Code. Then links in source code become clickable.
    </p>

    <h3>Steps in learning</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Read a small piece of the example code, don't worry if don't understand or don't understand all.</li>
        <li>Write under the example the same in your own code, possibly first 100% similar to the example. Peek as
            little as possible. Naturally you cannot use same names foo/bar/a/b/c/d/e, thus use e.g.
            silly/billy/v/w/x/y/z
            to avoid name clashes</li>
        <li>Change it if need to learn it deeper. Try if it still works like you think</li>
        <li>If need to learn something even better, make your own similar example</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        (SORRY: It's not possible to put them inside functions and call them from buttons, as then
        global scope would turn into function scope which would ruin _some_ of the
        demonstrated effects. So manual commenting and uncommenting needed.)
